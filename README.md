# Christmas Mad Lib

Fun With Python for Christmas

 - I got the idea to create this Mad Lib program while going through the book "Learn Python the hard way" by Zed A. Shaw.

 - Setup: To run the following application, I used these:
     - Spyder 3.0 (You may use others)
     - Python 3.7.X
  
  - You will utilize the 'ChristmasMadLib.py' and run the program.  Please follow the prompts and input information after the statements or questions.
