# Christmas Mad Lib

Fun With Python for Christmas

 - I got the idea to create this Mad Lib program while going through the book "Learn Python the hard way" by Zed A. Shaw.  It's the Christmas season so you might as well make your own song.

 - Setup: To run the following application, I used these:
     - Spyder 3.0 (You may use others)
     - Python 3.7.X
  
  - You will utilize the 'ChristmasMadLib.py' and run the program.  Please follow the prompts and input information after the statements or questions.
